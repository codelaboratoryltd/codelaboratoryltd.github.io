## How to get started with Software Development 
the first step that will be required of you when starting out is to get an email address created or set up in order to receive and send relevant information and invites to other developers.
To do this you would need to firstly access your personal email account and enable the 2-factor authentication factor as well as verify the email address is both able to receive and send mail, the way in which we do this is by using a tool called ismyemailworking 
[click here](http://ismyemailworking.com/)
to create the forwarding address using Gmail you will need to log in to the destination address and open the accounts tab in the settings menu from here the next step is to click the add another address in to send mail as section and thn untick the treat as alias box that comes up, you will then need to use the correct server type and the password that is generated for the new address to finish setting up the business email forwarder. it is at this point that the ismyemail working tool will be used.

## Tools needed for initial development

after setting up the business email explained in the previous section the next step is to get your work machine up to date with all the required software versions and tools.
these are the tools needed from the get go:

##homebrew 
Homebrew is used to install the other tools in a bash window as well as used to update certain aspects. this software can be downloaded off of Google Chrome by using the following link [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) after down you copy the code on the website you will then need to open up the standard terminal that comes on your chosen software and paste the line into the terminal to install the program.

##iterm2
iterm 2 is an upgraded terminal that can be installed and used instead of the preset as it has a much nicer and easier to understand interface to download this new terminal follow the link to the website and download the version that is newest or that runs best on your machines specifications [iterm2](https://iterm2.com/downloads.html)

##GitHub
GitHub is what is known as a vcs or version control software it is used by the developers in a business to access the same files and edit sections without it affecting the other developers actions even though it is the same file it creates separate branches, think of these like a parallel universe as everything is the same however if one changes there is no affect to the other branches of the software. to join the git hub for your business you will need to be sent an invitation by a member of the organisation.[GitHub](https://github.com/)

##slack
Slack is a software similar to GitHub in the fact that it is used within an organisation however the varying factor is that slack is only used to communicate via text channels as well as audio and video calls. to install slack it is similar to GitHub as it is downloaded from chrome and then an account is created, before you are able to communicate with the other members of the organisation you must receive an invitation just like is the case when first installing GitHub after this the software is easy to use and is very efficient at allowing multiple members to communicate at the same time in different text channels or servers.[Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/) 

##golang
golang is a type of programming language that is used by many types of developers for creating the software as it is a much easier and smoother language to use than some other available languages not only this, but it also has a much faster run and compile time when compared to other similar types of languages. it is also a lot easier to learn to use than other available languages making it a great choice for someone who is just starting out in this industry. the installation for goland is fairly simple it is downloaded off of chrome and the file is then opened up and installed onto the machine in the case of a MAC it is dragged into the application's folder. once the program is open and running you can link it to your GitHub account as this allows the programmer to access the different URLs they are currently working on whilst inside the goland window allowing a much more convenient method of opening and finding required files.[goland](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/promo/?source=google&medium=cpc&campaign=10165081599&gclid=CjwKCAjwy7CKBhBMEiwA0Eb7ajtsjeN8VB1aZAl00Xbf3ypifKKEil0FfV_MOqd8Xy_x1gWWpnQNmBoCiesQAvD_BwE) a good website to learn the basics of goland is [tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/go/index.php) as it offers a well explained tutorial as well as opportunities to test out the different functions and factors explained throughout as well as small exercises to help you learn by doing practical and theoretical training.
